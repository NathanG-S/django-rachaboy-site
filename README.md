# django-post-site-Rachaboy-IT
Hi everyone
This is my new post site named Rachaboy IT, it is open source habr clon–µ (https://habr.com/ru/all/)

I made this site for half a year and i'm learned a lot off new things like django signals, ckeditor, django-taggit, database relationships and much more.
I will really appreciate if you will show me some errors in my code and will contribute my project.
Also I will be glad if you tell me what you would like to see in my project in the future, thks and keep coding.
